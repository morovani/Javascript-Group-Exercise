## How They Got Their Powers (Origin Summary)

Reed Richards designed an experimental spacecraft to study cosmic radiation in space. Concerned that a rival 
nation might weaponize space exploration first, the team launched prematurely without adequate shielding.

Crew:

* Reed Richards
* Susan Storm
* Johnny Storm
* Ben Grimm (pilot)

During the mission, they were exposed to intense cosmic rays. Upon returning to Earth, each developed powers consistent with their physiology and personality traits:

* Reed → Elastic molecular structure
* Sue → Light-bending invisibility and force fields
* Johnny → Combustive plasma generation
* Ben → Massive, rock-like transformation with super strength

Unlike many heroes, they did **not** attempt to hide their identities. They publicly embraced their transformation.

## Concise Summary

The Fantastic Four are a publicly known superhero family who gained powers from cosmic radiation during a space mission. Rather than 
acting as masked vigilantes, they serve as scientific explorers and defenders of Earth. Their guiding principle is not a battle cry, 
but a belief: **that knowledge, unity, and family can push humanity forward.**
